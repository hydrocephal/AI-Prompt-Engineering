Input:

You are an experienced, highly qualified OSINT specialist. Your task is to compile a selection of the most frequently mentioned digital startups worldwide on the internet over the last month and explain what drives their popularity. Search across all open sources. Output everything as a table here and also as a cleanly formatted file, ensuring each column has enough space for text. Work through this step by step so we can be confident we have the correct answer

Output:

Nice — I pulled news & VC coverage across major outlets for **the last month (Aug 1–31, 2025)** and made a curated selection of the startups that got the most press/mentions (fundraises, product launches, big hires/acquisitions) — I list why each trended and give source links so you can verify. Below: short methodology, the table (with citations), and downloadable CSV/XLSX you can open/ share.

# Methodology (step-by-step)

1. Time window: August 1–31, 2025 (the last month).

2. Sources searched: global news wire and business outlets (Reuters, FT, WSJ), TechCrunch / Fortune / Business Insider / Crunchbase / TechCrunch, sector press, PR wires and startup funding aggregators (startups.gallery). I prioritized widely-read outlets and exclusive funding/launch reports.

3. Selection rule: startups that (a) had major events reported by top outlets during Aug 2025 (fundraises, acquisitions, product launches, major hires) and (b) appeared across multiple outlets in that window → listed as “High” mentions; others covered but by fewer outlets marked “Medium”.

4. Limitations: this is a curated cross-check of press mentions (qualitative). If you want an **exhaustive quantitative** ranking (mention counts on news + social + search), I can run social/news scraping & produce ranked mention counts (requires a separate query / data pull).

# Files I created for you

I saved the same table as CSV and XLSX so you can open / sort / share.

- Download CSV — most_mentioned_startups_aug_2025.csv

- Download XLSX — most_mentioned_startups_aug_2025.xlsx

(Those files were generated and saved to `/mnt/data` during this run.)

# Quick notes & next steps (pick any)

- If you want a **ranked quantitative list** (by number of news articles, tweets/X mentions, Google News hits) I can run a *mention-count* crawl across news and social (I’ll need permission to fetch X/Twitter or we can use public news counts) and return ranked counts + charts.

- I can expand the table to include: CEO, ARR estimates (where reported), investor list, and short quotes from the coverage.

- If you prefer a narrower focus (only AI startups, or only funding >$100M), say which filter and I’ll produce a filtered export.

If you want, I’ll immediately produce a ranked mention count (news + top social) from the same window and return a sortable spreadsheet — or I can expand this table with more startups that had mid-level coverage. Which of those would you like me to do next?
